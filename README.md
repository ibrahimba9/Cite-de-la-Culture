This is an academic project about developing a web application and a Desktop application for the management of the resources and services of the Cultural City of Tunis.

My task in this project was to develop a forum of discussion and integrate it into the application.

The folder "Java App" contains the Java / JavaFX Project of the Desktop Application.

The folder "Web App with Symfony" contains the Symfony Project of the Web Application.

My work includes:

Creating a discussion thread
posting messages
Responding to messages
Multi-select filter of the threads
Reporting inappropriate discussions and messages
Creating a Follow option for threads
Pulling notifications from the followed discussions
Private messaging between users
Supervising the Forum from the admin interface
###### This project was developed during the second semester of my third year of engineering study (2018 - 2019)
